Hello
I wrote a program that translates all text in html file from one language to the second 
The reason I decided to write this code is because I was asked to do one of the jobs I applied for 
there was to download the site and translate it into another language in html but there was a need to translate the help of a translator or your own methods and I decided to make my method
pros 
- Translates text automatically
minuses
- it’s quite slow 
- sometimes when I tested different html files the program deleted css that was written in html code  
- she can’t translate absolutely everything because I’ve learned that not all words are translated
